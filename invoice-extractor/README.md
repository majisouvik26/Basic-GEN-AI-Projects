# Multi-Language Invoice Extractor

This is a robust application that uses the Google Generative AI (Gemini Pro Vision) model to extract information from invoices in multiple languages. The application allows users to upload an invoice image and ask questions about the details on the invoice. The model will analyze the image and provide responses based on the user's questions.
