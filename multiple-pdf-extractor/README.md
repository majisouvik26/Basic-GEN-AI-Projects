# Chat with Multiple PDF using Gemini-Pro

This application allows you to upload multiple PDF files and ask questions related to the content in those files. It uses the Google Generative AI (Gemini-Pro) model and the Langchain library to process the PDF files, split the text into chunks, create embeddings, and answer your questions based on the relevant context.

## Live Demo

You can access the live demo of this application on Hugging Face Spaces: [https://huggingface.co/spaces/souvikmaji22/chat-with-multiple_pdf](https://huggingface.co/spaces/souvikmaji22/chat-with-multiple_pdf)

## Clone the Repository

To get started, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/majisouvik26/GEN-AI-Projects.git
```

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, you need to set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies. For example, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Anaconda or Miniconda if you haven't already.

2. Create a new virtual environment with Python 3.9:

```
conda create -p venv python=3.9 -y
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

```
conda activate venv
```

4. Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt`(you can find this file [here]([https://huggingface.co/spaces/souvikmaji22/lfw_face_recognition](https://github.com/majisouvik26/GEN-AI-Projects/blob/main/requirements.txt))) file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Environment Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add your Google API key:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual Google API key.

## Running the App

1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated.

2. Run the Streamlit app using the following command:

```
streamlit run multiple-pdf-extractor.py
```

3. The app will open in your default web browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can access it by clicking the URL provided in the terminal.

## Usage

1. Upload your PDF files by clicking the "Upload your PDF files" button in the sidebar and selecting the desired PDF files.
2. Click the "Submit & Proceed" button to process the uploaded PDF files.
3. Once the processing is complete, you can ask questions related to the content in the PDF files by typing your question in the input field.
4. The response generated by the Gemini-Pro model, based on the relevant context from the PDF files, will be displayed below.
